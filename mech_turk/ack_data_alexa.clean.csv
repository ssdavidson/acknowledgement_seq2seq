"This might answer your question:  According to Reference.com:  Although many people dismiss honey as unhealthy because it is high in fructose, it is actually a healthy, natural food that has a number of health benefits.

"This might answer your question:  According to Reference.com:  Track a package by visiting the shipping company's website and entering the relevant tracking number.  Most package tracking numbers are between 10 and 20 digits long, and some may contain letters as well.  Tracking options typically require an additional fee when shipping packages via the U.S.  Postal Service.  Packages sent with UPS or FedEx automatically contain tracking numbers.  Typically carriers update package status reports only once or twice per day, so the websites may not contain the most up-to-date information.

"This might answer your question:  According to Reference.com:  Experts agree that most runners need at least one or two days off from running each week.  Taking a weekly rest day reduces the likelihood and frequency of overuse injuries.  When the body has a chance to recover and repair muscle tissue, it makes the next run feel easier.  The timing and frequency of rest days depends on the runner's experience and fitness level.  Beginners should start out running every other day, allowing their bodies to rest and recover for a full day between runs while still building consistency.  Advanced runners may not need a complete rest day, instead opting to cross-train with strength training, yoga, swimming or another non-running activity.
